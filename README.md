# drinking-water-treatment
A hardware based project to analyse the quality of water and classify it as fit or unfit for drinking

Problems Addressed:

    • Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces.
    • Contaminated water can transmit diseases such diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio. Contaminated drinking water is estimated to cause 485 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.
    • By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas.

Overview:

      The project is based on the data science that estimate the drinking water parameter data collected from particular area according to IS 10500 : 2012 (Drinking Water Specification). The result that get from estimation will use to categorize the particular zone Red, Yellow and Green.

    • Green Zone :- Safe zone
    • Yellow Zone :- warning

Goals:

    • To aware people to use conventional methods of treatment of drinking water.

    • Raising awareness towards controlling water pollution.

Tech Stacks Required:

    • ML
    • iot
    • Raspberry pi
    • Android
    • web

Roadmap Overview:

    • First time interval -2 months – Collecting data of particular area.
    • Second time interval -3 months- Estimation of data sets.


Approximate count of contributors required: 15-20
