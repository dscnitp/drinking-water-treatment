# drinking-water-treatment
A hardware based project to analyse the quality of water and classify it as fit or unfit for drinking

## Problems Addressed:

* Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces.</br>
* Contaminated water can transmit diseases such diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio.</br>

* Contaminated drinking water is estimated to cause 485 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.<br>

* By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas.<br>

## Overview:

The project is based on the data science that estimate the drinking water parameter data collected from particular area according to IS 10500 : 2012 (Drinking Water Specification). The result that get from estimation will use to categorize the particular zone Red, Yellow and Green.</br>

* Green Zone :- Safe zone</br>
* Yellow Zone :- warning<br>
* Red Zone :- Alarming Situation.</br>
      
## Goals:

* To aware people to use conventional methods of treatment of drinking water.<br>

* As the conventional methods of treatment of water are not so effective. Therefor developing sensors based cost effective methods.</br>

* Raising awareness towards controlling water pollution.</br>

## Tech Stacks Required:
* ML
* iot
* Raspberry pi
* Android
* Web

## Roadmap Overview:

* First time interval -2 months – Collecting data of particular area.

* Second time interval -3 months- Estimation of data sets.

## Approximate count of contributors required: 15-20
